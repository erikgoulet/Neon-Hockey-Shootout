- **Power Display**: Real-time percentage shown
- **Trade-off**: More power = less accuracy

### Goalie AI

- **Position Clamping**: Stays within realistic goalie area
- **Difficulty Scaling**: AI prediction accuracy varies by level

### Physics Engine
- **Puck Movement**: Realistic trajectory with gravity
- **Ice Friction**: Puck slows naturally
- **Rebounds**: Pucks bounce off goalie realistically
- **3D Perspective**: True depth perception

## Pro Tips

### Aiming Strategy
1. **Watch the goalie**: They move to predict your shot
2. **Aim for corners**: Harder for goalie to reach
3. **Mix up shot types**: Keep the goalie guessing
4. **Use less power**: Sometimes accuracy beats power

### Scoring Tips
- **Top Shelf**: Aim high in the corners for bonus points
- **Five Hole**: Shoot low between the pads when goalie is standing
- **Deke**: Move your aim quickly before shooting to fool the goalie
- **Patience**: Don't always shoot at full power

### Advanced Techniques
- **Quick Flick**: Short, fast swipe for snap shots
- **Power Swipe**: Long swipe + slap shot for maximum velocity
- **Direction Change**: Curve your swipe to add deception
- **Aim Prediction Mastery**: Use the trajectory line to find gaps
- **Backhand Surprise**: Use rarely to catch goalie off-guard
- **Rebound Awareness**: Watch for pucks bouncing back
